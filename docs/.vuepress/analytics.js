/*
 * Consent-gated Google Analytics.
 *
 * Nothing here runs on the server and nothing touches the network until the reader has explicitly
 * accepted: the gtag.js script is injected only after a `granted` decision, so a visitor who
 * ignores or declines the banner never has an analytics cookie written. The decision itself is
 * normally kept in localStorage rather than a cookie, which keeps the "remember my choice" storage
 * strictly necessary and outside the consent requirement; when the browser refuses that store the
 * answer is held in memory for the current page session instead.
